## Introduction

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This sequence starts from 0 and 1, leading to 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so forth. This repository aims to provide a clear and efficient implementation of the Fibonacci series in various programming languages, along with examples and use cases.

## What is the Fibonacci Series?

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

This series appears in various domains, from computer science to art, and even in nature, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem or the pattern of seeds in a sunflower.

### Mathematical Properties

- **Golden Ratio**: As the Fibonacci numbers increase, the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the Golden Ratio (approximately 1.618).
- **Binet's Formula**: There is a closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers, known as Binet's formula.

## Features

- Multiple implementations in various programming languages.
- Clear examples demonstrating how to use the Fibonacci series.
- Performance comparisons between different algorithms.
- Visualizations of Fibonacci numbers and their properties.

## Installation

To get started with the Fibonacci Series, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/litomi/Fibonacci-Series.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Fibonacci-Series
   ```

3. Download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/litomi/Fibonacci-Series/releases). Execute the downloaded file to run the program.

## Usage

The Fibonacci Series can be used in various ways. Here are some examples:

### Python Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

n = 10
print(f"The {n}th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci(n)}")
```

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1) return 1;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

let n = 10;
console.log(`The ${n}th Fibonacci number is: ${fibonacci(n)}`);
```

## Code Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
